<p>In March 2024, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-massive-alleged-att-data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tens of millions of records allegedly breached from AT&amp;T were posted to a popular hacking forum</a>. Dating back to August 2021, the data was originally posted for sale before later being freely released. At the time, AT&amp;T maintained that there had not been a breach of their systems and that the data originated from elsewhere. 12 days later, <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2024/addressing-data-set-released-on-dark-web.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT&amp;T acknowledged that data fields specific to them were in the breach and that it was not yet known whether the breach occurred at their end or that of a vendor</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/att-reset-account-passcodes-customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT&amp;T also proceeded to reset customer account passcodes</a>, an indicator that there was sufficient belief passcodes had been compromised. The incident exposed names, email and physical addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and US social security numbers.</p>

<p>In 2014, a file allegedly containing data hacked from <a href="https://www.couponmom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coupon Mom</a> was created and included 11 million email addresses and plain text passwords. On further investigation, the file was also found to contain data indicating it had been sourced from <a href="https://armorgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armor Games</a>. Subsequent verification with HIBP subscribers confirmed the passwords had previously been used and many subscribers had used either Coupon Mom or Armor Games in the past. On disclosure to both organisations, each found that the data did not represent their entire customer base and possibly includes records from other sources with common subscribers. The breach has subsequently been flagged as "unverified" as the source cannot be emphatically proven. In July 2020, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/how-beeradvocate-learned-theyd-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data was also found to contain BeerAdvocate accounts sourced from a previously unknown breach</a>.</p>

<p>An alleged breach of the dating website <a href="http://www.justdate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justdate.com</a> began circulating in approximately September 2016. Comprised of over 24 million records, the data contained various personal attributes such as email addresses, dates of birth and physical locations. However, upon verification with HIBP subscribers, only a fraction of the data was found to be accurate and no account owners recalled using the Justdate.com service. This breach has consequently been flagged as <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-fabricated-data-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fabricated</a>; it's highly unlikely the data was sourced from Justdate.com.</p>

<p>In February 2023, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Kodi Foundation suffered a data breach that exposed more than 400k user records</a>. Attributed to an account belonging to "a trusted but currently inactive member of the forum admin team", the breach involved the administrator account creating a database backup that was subsequently downloaded before being sold on a hacking forum. The breach exposed email and IP addresses, usernames, genders and passwords stored as MyBB salted hashes. The Kodi Foundation elected to self-submit impacted email addresses to HIBP.</p>

<p>In November 2014, the online game <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/gaming-site-warframe-hacked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe was hacked</a> and 819k unique email addresses were exposed. Allegedly due to a SQL injection flaw in Drupal, the attack exposed usernames, email addresses and data in a "pass" column which adheres to the salted SHA12 password hashing pattern used by Drupal 7. Digital Extremes (the developers of Warframe), asserts the salted hashes are of "alias names" rather than passwords.</p>

After identifying the malicious site, WP Sandbox took it offline, contacted the 858 people who provided information to it then self-submitted their addresses to HIBP. The phishing page requested both email addresses and passwords.</p>

<p>In December 2011, the Chinese dating site known as <a href="http://nic.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1018/1909.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zhenai.com suffered a data breach</a> that impacted 5 million subscribers. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as "unverified". The data in the breach contains email addresses and plain text passwords. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.</a></p>
